# Describing a language

How to describe a language?
* "Shut the door!"
* Sound, order, meaning of individual words
* Different levels.

Phonetics:
* Back to 4000 BC. Without writting.
* How we describe and group together sounds?
* What parts of our mouth to articulate?
* It is independent of the language of the speaker.

Phonology:
* Patterns and variations.
* For example: _tpat_, _ISender_, _bintlement_, _zvetsin_. Which one can be English?
* Sounds that fit together: decided by humans; and they like to be efficient.
* Find smallest sounds of units that changed in a word, change the meaning.
* E.g. /p/ by /b/ pig → big. Those minimals are called _phonemes_.
* Hypothesis: many languages will have similar sounds.
* 83 % of some languages have /s/ sound.

Graphetics:
* Physical parts of written symbols.
* E.g. in clay: removed with hard tool.
* In paper: you destroy the pencil but not the paper.
* Materials

Graphology:
* We know how those marks are made, but how those representations have meanings?
* E.g. writting _what_ vs. _vhat_ or _that_.

Aside on Writing Systems:
* Broca's area is associated with language.
* Vocal apparatus is needed: wind pipe, mouth, etc.
* Where written was started:
    * Indus Valley (Indus language)
    * Sumerians in Mesopotamia (cuneiform)
    * Egyptians (hieroglyphics)

What is a writing system?
* "A system of more or less permanent marks used to represent an utterance [written or spoken] so that it can be recovered more or less exacrlt without ht eintervention of the utterer."
* How many are there? More or less 114.
* Some of them are not decyphered yet.
* Some languages have several writting systems: latin alphabet and cyrilic. 

Morphology:
* How do we construct words?
* Small meaningful elements: morphemes.
* dis-agree-ment-s: 4 morphemes / un-happi-ness: 3 morphemes.
* Inflectional
* Derivational

Inflectional morphology:
* Marking differnt forms of one word.
* -s for singular/plural, see/saw for present/past, go/goes etc.
* It is not necessarily additive.
* Does not change the syntactic category of the word (stills a noun, adjective, etc).

Derivational morphology:
* Creating new words with morphemes.
* insitute → institution → institutional → instituionalise...

Syntax: 
* No consensus of what constitues a sentence.
* The complete expression of a single thought / consists of a subject and a predicate / ... many definitions.
* Traditionally: sentence → clauses → phrases → words → morphemes.
* Represented in a phrase structure tree. Bottom is concrete, top is abstract.
* Grammar: atalogue of structural descriptions that describe the sentence structure.
* Structural descriptions are grammar rules.
* Prescriptive grammar is learnt in highschool. Helps to normalize the language
* Descriptive grammar allows to understand the rules we follow.

Semantics:
* Study of meaning in language.
* Words name things and their meaning is the thing they name (?).
* In NLP, we do not care about the meaning, but to derive a representation.

Discourse analysis:
* How discourse is created.
* Textual structure:
    * Coreference. With pronouns: how do we know what refers to? Analyzing context. What does _he_ refers to?
    * Ellipsis. What has been omitted? _Where did you see her? Ø Next to the library_
    * Coherence. Goes back to _rhetorical structure theory_. Texts should be also coherence.
    * Conversational structure. Turn taking (e.g. roblems with Internet communication).

Pragmatics:
* How humans use language in social settings.
* E.g. using social knowledge (_What time is it?_ _Well, you have taken a 5 hours nap_).
