# Introduction

Week 1
* Linguistincs
* Assignment (individual)

Week 2
* Machine learning. Concepts: laplacian → ... → neural networks
* Assignment (individual)

Week 3
* Combine
* Choice of projects as inspiration. Brief

Natural Language Processing:
* People is good at using language, machines... meh
* Languages not unique: not unique to humans (elephants, birds).

What is language:
* Areas: broca / Wernicke in the head.
* The whole brain is used to process language.
* Knowledge, content, planning, imagination.
* Velar closure: drink vs. breathing. We can open/close very quickly.
* Animals are good with vowels.
* Started many (thousands) of years ago, but what it's said is gone.

Written language:
* Written language is approx 3000.
* Not every language can be written.
* Not "transiency" (transiency).
* Written language extends cognition (you are "more intelligent").
* Mapping speech to text.

Grand challenges:
* Machine translation.
* Sequence to sequence: I like your hat / J'aime otn chapeau.
* Humans can teach languages to each other well.
* Ground sound to actions: movements + objects + saying word.

Chinese room:
* Person in a room: gets language A as in. They don't understand, but they have a translation given a production rule. Do you know then language B? Nope.
* Symbol manipulation ≠ consciousness.

When to get translation?:
* In two years, in five years...? Never?
* "Every time I fire a linguistics, accuracy goes up"

Dialog:
* We prefer to communicate with dialog.
* Screen is black and white. Give instruction to computer: "PICK UP A BIG RED BLOCK". "OK".

Turing test:
* Whether the thing you are talking with is a human or a computer.
* Remove distracting factors: everything is mediated through a computer.
* Conversation through typing.
* Good questions for the test are the ones that involve context.

Semantic extraction:
* "Frames" - Minsky. Scripts that we learn (go to the store, pick up a basket, pick up items, pay...).
* Solves the problem of bureaucracy - interpreting legal documents.

Language generation:
* Summarisation: reduce a document.
* Descriptions: map + image + location + camera → describe.
* Journalism: sport and stocks market. Very standarized format.
* Timestamp + summary + prior context + ... + past event.

Information filtering:
* What to include? There can be way too much.

Legal issues:
* Who owns the content?
* Who is responsible?

Question answering:
* In: question. Out: answer.
* Natural interrogaiton mode: "Where are you going?", "How tall is the Eiffel tower?"
* When you talk is less natural to speak queries.
