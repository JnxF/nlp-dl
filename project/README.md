## Abstract

False friends are words in different languages that are written or pronounced similarly, but differ significantly in their meaning. Their impact on second language learning is significant, but generating lists of false friends is a difficult task that requires the manual work of experts. In this paper we analyze the impact of adding phonetic transcriptions to Machine Learning false friends models trained on Romance languages.
